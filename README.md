As researchers, we firmly believe in the concept of reproducible research.

Thus, we release the codes of simulation, algorithm development, and testing online on GitHub for the research paper "A hamming distance and spearman-correlation based star identification algorithm" (https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8374923). This repository contains the codes for simulation and testing of the star identification algorithm based on hamming distance and spearman-correlation.

Please cite our paper (citation details below) properly, if you use the code for simulation, development or testing of a new star identification algorithm or comparison & benchmarking with the above-mentioned alogirhtm.

This code is only for academic and research purposes. Commerical use of this code is not permitted.
