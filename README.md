As researchers, we firmly believe in the concept of reproducible research. Thus, we release the codes of simulation, algorithm development, and testing online on GitHub. This repository contains the codes for simulation and testing of the star identification algorithm based on hamming distance and spearman-correlation.

This code is only for academic and research purposes.
